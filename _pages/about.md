Hello! I'm Denise, a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the [Swallowing Research Laboratory](https://swallow.edu.hku.hk/) of the University of Hong Kong.  


## My research interest
Throughout the years as a young academic and clinician, I have developed a strong interest in the field of swallowing and dysphagia. At present, I am particularly interested in the effects of swallowing exercises on the elderly brain. My proposed dissertation involves the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate the potential use of various swallowing exercises in preventing and/or reversing neural changes that contribute to age-related swallowing changes. 


## My background and experience
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Speech Pathology from the University of the Philippines Manila in 2017. After graduation, I became an instructor at the same university doing undergraduate classroom teaching and clinical supervision for two years. I also had my own private practice catering to home-based clients during this time. Before pursuing my postgraduate studies in 2020, I transitioned to the hospital setting and served as a full-time clinician seeing both in and out-patients across varied age groups.
