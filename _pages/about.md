Hello! I'm Denise, a speech-language pathologist and researcher at the [Swallowing Research Laboratory](https://swallow.edu.hku.hk/), University of Hong Kong.  


## My research interest
Throughout the years as an academic and clinician, I have developed a strong interest in the field of swallowing and dysphagia. My current research focuses on exmaining the effects of swallowing exercises on the neurophysiology of healthy adults using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).


## My background and experience
I earned my Bachelor's in Speech Pathology from the University of the Philippines Manila in 2017. I then taught and supervised undergraduate students at the same university for two years while managing a private home-based practice. Afterward, I transitioned into a medical SLP, treating diverse in- and out-patient populations. I pursued full-time postgraduate studies in 2020 and completed my PhD in Speech-Language Pathology, specializing in swallowing, at the University of Hong Kong in 2025. <br>
