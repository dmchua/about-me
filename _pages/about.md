Hello! I'm Denise, a speech-language pathologist and researcher at the [Swallowing Research Laboratory](https://swallow.edu.hku.hk/), University of Hong Kong.  


## My research interest
Throughout the years as an academic and clinician, I have developed a strong interest in the field of swallowing and dysphagia. My current research focuses on the effects of swallowing exercises on the neurophysiology of healthy adults. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), I am investigating the potential use of these exercises in delaying and/or reversing neural changes that contribute to age-related swallowing changes. 


## My background and experience
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Speech Pathology from the University of the Philippines Manila in 2017. After graduation, I became an instructor at the same university doing undergraduate classroom teaching and clinical supervision for two years. I also had my own private practice catering to home-based clients during this time. I then transitioned to the hospital setting as a medical SLP seeing both in and out-patients across varied age groups before pursuing my postgraduate studies full-time in 2020. I obtained my PhD in Speech-Language Pathology with a focus on swallowing from the University of Hong Kong in 2025.<br>
